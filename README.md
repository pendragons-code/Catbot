# Catbot
  One of my prototypes for catbot.

# Configuration
  To use this bot, you need a few things. First you need a [tenor API key](https://tenor.com/gifapi/documentation#quickstart-share) and [Discord app/bot token](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro).   
  `.env` file:
  ```
  token = discord-api-key-here
  tenorkey = tenor-key-here
  ```   
  `config.json` file:
  ```
  {
    "prefix": "cat",
    "ownerID": "",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
  ```
  # Commands:
  Not a whole lot, as of now, there are just 2. Mainly `gif`, `cat`, `help`, `ping`, `usage`.
  
  # package config
  The stuff in the `package.json` file is probably outdated.
